# Amazon Clone Project

## Overview
The Amazon Clone project is a fully functional e-commerce web application designed to simulate a real-world online shopping experience. This project demonstrates my skills in front-end development, state management, and dynamic user interactions. It offers essential features such as search and filtering, shopping cart functionality, order management, and delivery tracking.
